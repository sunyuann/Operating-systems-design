# Operating-systems-design
Operating systems design based on OS/161 and MIPS design

Tackled synchronisation and concurrency issues within the software environment of the OS/161 kernel services.

Implemented software bridge between a set of file-related system calls inside the kernel and the VFS implementation.

Implemented virtual memory sub-system of OS/161 that takes advantage of the simulated hardware by implementing management of the MIPS software-managed Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB).
